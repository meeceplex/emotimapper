www.emotimapper.com, mood mapping and forcasting project.
---------------------------------------------------------

Brief description of idea:
--------------------------
I am creating a web app with the long term goal of forecasting mood over time and area, as a novelty. While the goal is too eventually base prediction on objective data, this beginning phase is an attempt to build a user base and a subjective mood data model (a users own interpretation of their mood), over time and area. The landing page should be streamlined and simple. Its purpose is to direct the user to either register, login or submit their mood anonymously. The subsequent page designs can vary, but the overall goal is to, after collecting the 3 data points, represent them on a color coded heat map layer. The mood will be averaged over a given radius, and associated with a color, then plotted on a map. An option should exist to animate the changes in averages over time per location. Eventually, their should be an option to enable other layers (as available), such as radar or satellite cloud coverage, so users can explore the possibility of trends in the mood/influence model. The app will be web-based, and functionality should be consistent across most platforms (id est, no Flash). I will be collecting usage demographics via Google analytics.

Basic Project:
--------------
A web app which collects subjective mood ratings from users, either registered or anonymous, then stores their input with their GPS location and time. The collected moods are then averaged, associated with a color, and displayed as a layer over a map. A heat map of moods.

Added Features:
---------------ï»¿
Near Field Communication tags; Programmed NFC tags can be posted at various locations. Scanning with a compatible device will open the site and prompt user to input their mood, then update the database with the GPS location, time and mood.

QR code for opening site and prompting user to input their mood, then update the database with GPS location, time and mood.


Wow/Cool Factor:
----------------
Concept of creating interactive hardware, so as to influence an objective data set. One such device is a low energy bluetooth "mood" ring, which will broadcast the wearer's mood (based on temperature and activity, or other metrics discovered to be associated with mood) to a mobile device and update the database with the mood, time and location.

Ability to animate map with "mood" layer over time, giving visual representation of general mood changes of an area over time. Ability to add additional layers, such as radar, so as to see if there exists a relationship between mood and weather.
